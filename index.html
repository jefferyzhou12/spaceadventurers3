                    &nbsp;&nbsp;As a solution to solve the problem of endless boredom, our team proposes a game crafted by Unity. Named <em>Station: Survival</em>, this game aims to incorporate an astronaut’s daily life and routine in a virtual world of obstacles and missions. In this game, the unexpected becomes expected, and from detrimental oxygen leaks to solar storms, these authentic scenarios become the expected in the game. As the events in this game progresses, astronauts learn to expect the unexpected, to prepare for anything, in a life-threatening situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Mistakes leading to great disasters are common in such risky missions in space, and through this game, astronauts play and learn, being entertained in a pressing environment. Containing necessities such as food, exercise, sleep, and others essential for daily life in space, astronauts learn to balance missions and personal interests with necessities in critical circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, life threatening issues are not unknown in space. With urgent operations, astronauts have to train their brain to think and process with haste in order to survive in this virtual world. From solar flares, which could disrupt radio waves and completely demolish technology, to oxygen leaks, which could pose a critical threat to life, these pressing situations force astronauts to concentrate to find a way out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A realistic environment is believed to be easiest to apply in an actual situation. This game provides just that. Featuring food, sleeping bags, and other realistic components of space life, this game includes an immersive experience in a world which is as realistic as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A game packed with action, pressing scenarios, realistic and immersive experience, risky missions, and more is undeniably a great one to play. Don’t just listen to this, why not check it out yourself?

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Our project is addressing a situation of boredom in space, and, while astronauts do work, experiment, and work under an environment with low gravity. However, such situations can become very dire in some scenarios, where, as NPR states, boredom disincentives eating, and while undereating comes from a variety of circumstances, boredom is one major cause of this. Additionally, malnutrition can significantly alter and degrade an astronauts performance, affecting the astronauts wellbeing as well as the astronauts general output. However, to solve this detrimental problem, our team proposes a game, coded from Unity, to entertain the astronauts when they are otherwise bored. In this game, we propose a virtual situation where astronauts must learn to survive alongside a variety of obstacles. This virtual world contains some real-life situations where astronauts must learn how to power through and survive. Not only does our game provide a solution to the seemingly endless hours of boredom, it provides a platform where essential aspects such as critical thinking and problem-solving come into play, with endless fun in a challenging scenario. This type of gaming technology provides an immersive gaming environment and endless entertainment while exercising the astronaut’s cognitive thinking. Not only is this game a truly noteworthy step into eliminating extracerresital boredom while strengthening the astronauts’ toughness and ableness.

                            Art and Science come hand and hand, and entrusting the area of art and design to her is crucial for the overall success of this project. As a website not only contains numbers, codes, and content, the overall design for websites is what defines a website. With the domain of art stretching into the domain of science, we then find out these two areas are complimentary. As art plays a key role in this project, this role is a great contribution.
