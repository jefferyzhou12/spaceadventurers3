                    &nbsp;&nbsp;As a solution to solve the problem of endless boredom, our team proposes a game crafted by Unity. Named <em>Station: Survival</em>, this game aims to incorporate an astronaut’s daily life and routine in a virtual world of obstacles and missions. In this game, the unexpected becomes expected, and from detrimental oxygen leaks to solar storms, these authentic scenarios become the expected in the game. As the events in this game progresses, astronauts learn to expect the unexpected, to prepare for anything, in a life-threatening situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Mistakes leading to great disasters are common in such risky missions in space, and through this game, astronauts play and learn, being entertained in a pressing environment. Containing necessities such as food, exercise, sleep, and others essential for daily life in space, astronauts learn to balance missions and personal interests with necessities in critical circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, life threatening issues are not unknown in space. With urgent operations, astronauts have to train their brain to think and process with haste in order to survive in this virtual world. From solar flares, which could disrupt radio waves and completely demolish technology, to oxygen leaks, which could pose a critical threat to life, these pressing situations force astronauts to concentrate to find a way out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A realistic environment is believed to be easiest to apply in an actual situation. This game provides just that. Featuring food, sleeping bags, and other realistic components of space life, this game includes an immersive experience in a world which is as realistic as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A game packed with action, pressing scenarios, realistic and immersive experience, risky missions, and more is undeniably a great one to play. Don’t just listen to this, why not check it out yourself?
